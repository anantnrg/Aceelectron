**Aceelectron** (pronounced *eÉªs-ÉªËˆlÉ›ktrÉ’n*) is an awesome Electron.js :electron:  boilerplate. It is designed to accelerate your Electron.js app develeopment. It includes by default, a customized window, titlebar, rounded corners, a transparent background, a custom icon and Hot Reloading. It is built so that you can get a head start into Electron.js and don't have to spend time creating a base environment for your project.

## Getting Started
The following instructons will help you to use this boilerplate for your own projects.

### Prerequisites
To use this boilerplate you have to have the following packages installed on your machine.
* Git CLI - [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [Mac OS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac), [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
* NodeJS - [Download](https://nodejs.org)


### Usage
To use Aceelectron, you have to clone this repository to your local machine. To do that, run the following command: </br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anantnrg/aceelectron <myproj>
```
Here ```myproj``` is the name of your Electron.js project.

Next, you have to install the required packages to run Electron.js. They have to be installed using Node.js. To install these packages run:
</br>
```bas
cd myproj
```
to change directory into your downloaded folder, then run
</br>
```bas
npm install
```
to install the dependencies and 
</br>
```bash
npm install electron electron-reload
```
to install Electron.js and the electron-reload package. The electron-reload package is what enables the Hot Reloading i.e., when you change the HTML, CSS or ```renderer.js``` file, your app will be reloaded automatically. Note that this does not reload the app if you make any changes to the ```main.js``` file.

Then you can run the app by entering
</br>
```bash
npm start
```
If everything works, then a window will open up like this
